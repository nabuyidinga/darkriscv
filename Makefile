# This the root makefile and the function of this file is call other
# makefiles. Of course, you need first set the GCC compiler path/name, the
# simulator path/name and the board model:
#
#   ARCH = rv32e
#  ARCH = rv32i
ARCH = rv32g
ENDIAN = _le
#ENDIAN = _be
# CROSS = riscv-elf
# CROSS = riscv32-unknown-elf
# CROSS = riscv32-embedded-elf
  CROSS = riscv32-unknown-linux-gnu
#CCPATH = /usr/local/share/toolchain-$(CROSS)/bin
 CCPATH = /opt/riscv/bin/
 ICARUS = /usr/local/bin/iverilog
#BOARD  = avnet_microboard_lx9
 BOARD  = xilinx_ac701_a200
#BOARD  = qmtech_sdram_lx16
#
# now you can just type 'make'

ROM = src/darksocv.rom                      # requires gcc for riscv
RAM = src/darksocv.ram                      # requires gcc for riscv
SIM = sim/darksocv.vcd                      # requires icarus verilog 
BIT = tmp/darksocv.bit                      # requires FPGA build tool

default: all
